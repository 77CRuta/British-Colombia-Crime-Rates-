Analysis of British Colombia Crime Rates

## Intro 
In British Columbia, the Crime Severity Index (CSI) for 2021 showed an overall increase, with several cities ranking above the Canadian average. Kelowna notably had the second-highest CSI at 122.3. Vancouver's CSI stood at 81.6, with the city also experiencing a significant rise in homicides compared to the previous year. A notable rise in the rate of level 1 sexual assault contributed to the increase in Canada's Violent CSI in 2021, marking the highest rate since 1997. Despite these increases, both Alberta and British Columbia contributed to a relative downward impact on the national CSIâ€‹.
